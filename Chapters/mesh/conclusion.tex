\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This chapter introduces \Mesh{}, a memory allocator that efficiently
performs \textit{compaction without relocation} to save memory for
unmanaged languages.  We show analytically that \Mesh{} provably
avoids catastrophic memory fragmentation with high probability, and
empirically show that \Mesh{} can substantially reduce memory
fragmentation for memory-intensive applications written in C/C++ with
low runtime overhead. %In future work, we plan to explore integrating \Mesh{} into language runtimes that do not currently support compaction, such as Go and Rust.

We have released \Mesh as an open source
project; it can be used with arbitrary C and C++ Linux and Mac OS X
binaries and can be downloaded at
