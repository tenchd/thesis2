\section{Summary of Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
For a number of memory-intensive applications, including aggressively
space-optimized applications like Firefox, \Mesh can substantially
reduce memory consumption (by 16\% to 39\%) while imposing a modest
impact on runtime performance (e.g., around 1\% for Firefox and
SPECint 2006). We find that \Mesh{}'s randomization can enable
substantial space reduction in the face of a regular allocation
pattern.
