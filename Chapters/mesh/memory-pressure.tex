They also have an established reputation for consuming significant
amounts of
memory~\cite{lifehacker-browser-slow,ff-ram-consumption,safari-ram-consumption}.
To address this problem, browser vendors have spent considerable
effort on shrinking their browsers' memory footprints~\cite{oilpan,
  ff-memory-reduction, edge-mem-reduction, safari-less-memory,
  ff-mem-2} and building diagnostic tools that track the memory
consumption of specific browser components~\cite{speed-up-gchrome,
  ff-about-memory}.
