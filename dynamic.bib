  abstract = {Modern architectures require data locality to achieve
                  performance. However, garbage-collected languages
                  like Java limit the ability of programmers to
                  influence object locality, and so impose a
                  significant performance penalty. We present custom
                  object layout, an approach that allows programmers
                  to control object layout in garbage-collected
                  languages. Custom object layout cooperates with
                  copying garbage collection. At collection time, the
                  garbage collector invokes programmer-supplied
                  methods that direct object placement. Custom object
                  layout is particularly effective at improving the
                  locality of classes with well-known traversal
                  patterns, such as dictionary data structures. We
                  show that using custom object layout can reduce
                  cache misses by 50\%-77\% and thus improves the
                  query performance of dictionary data structures by
                  20\%.}

  abstract = {We present an optimizing compiler that dramatically
                  improves the performance of shell script
                  languages. Our prototype system, called Shark,
                  performs a number of domainspecific
                  optimizations. We show that, subject to some
                  constraints, we can treat file I/O in shell
                  languages like variables in regular programming
                  languages. This insight allows us to leverage
                  traditional compiler analyses to eliminate temporary
                  files, transform file-based I/O to pipes, and
                  extract coarse-grained parallelism. We show how we
                  can further improve performance by eliminating
                  process creation overhead, which can dominate the
                  runtime of shell scripts. By modifying just a few
                  lines of code, we can convert external commands like
                  grep into dynamic libraries. Shark loads these
                  libraries just once so that subsequent invocations
                  execute with the speed of function calls, and then
                  unloads them when they are no longer needed. We
                  present results with our prototype demonstrating
                  substantial speedups over the bash shell.},

 abstract = {Programming high-performance server applications is
                  challenging: it is both complicated and error-prone
                  to write the concurrent code required to deliver
                  high performance and scalability. Server performance
                  bottlenecks are difficult to identify and
                  correct. Finally, it is difficult to predict server
                  performance prior to deployment.  This paper
                  presents Flux, a language that dramatically
                  simplifies the construction of scalable
                  high-performance server applications. Flux lets
                  programmers compose off-the-shelf, sequential C or
                  C++ functions into concurrent servers. Flux programs
                  are type-checked and guaranteed to be
                  deadlock-free. We have built a number of servers in
                  Flux, including a web server with PHP support, an
                  image-rendering server, a BitTorrent peer, and a
                  game server. These Flux servers match or exceed the
                  performance of their counterparts written entirely
                  in C. By tracking hot paths through a running
                  server, Flux simplifies the identification of
                  performance bottlenecks. The Flux compiler also
                  automatically generates discrete event simulators
                  that accurately predict actual server performance
                  under load and with different hardware resources.}

  abstract = {A multitude of research and commercial projects have
                  proposed contributory systems that utilize wasted
                  CPU cycles, idle memory and free disk space found on
                  end-user machines. These applications include
                  distributed computation such as signal processing
                  and protein folding, peer-to-peer backup, and
                  large-scale distributed storage. While users are
                  generally willing to give up unused CPU cycles, the
                  use of memory by contributory applications deters
                  participation in such systems. Contributory
                  applications pollute the machine's memory, forcing
                  user pages to be evicted to disk. This paging can
                  disrupt user activity for seconds or even minutes.
                  In this paper, we describe the design and
                  implementation of an operating system mechanism to
                  support transparent contribution of memory. A
                  transparent memory manager (TMM) controls memory
                  usage by contributory applications, ensuring that
                  users will not notice an increase in the miss rate
                  of their applications. TMM is able to protect user
                  pages such that page miss overhead is limited to
                  1.7\%, while donating hundreds of megabytes of
                  memory.}
